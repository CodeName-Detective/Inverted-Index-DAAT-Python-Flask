# Inverted-Index-DAAT-Python-Flask
This repository hosts a Python-based project that implements an advanced Inverted Index using a Linked List structure, and Boolean Retrieval. It leverages Flask to create a web application that allows users to perform Boolean queries through a Document-at-a-time (DAAT) strategy. Optimized for fast retrieval and efficient storage.
