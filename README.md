# Inverted-Index-DAAT-Python-Flask

This repository contains the implementation of an Inverted Index using Linked Lists and Flask in Python. It allows for efficient Boolean queries using a Document-at-a-time (DAAT) strategy, ideal for understanding Information Retrieval concepts.

## Files Description

**src/indexer.py:** Contains the core logic for building the inverted index.

**src/linkedlist.py:** Implements the linked list data structure used in the index.

**src/preprocessor.py:** Handles the preprocessing of documents, including tokenization and normalization.

**src/run_project.py:** The main script to run the project. It sets up the Flask application and endpoints for querying.
